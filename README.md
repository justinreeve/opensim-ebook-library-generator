OpenSim E-Book Library Generator
===============================

Create bookshelves and books from a PDF ebook library, complete with books you can open and read.

Edit the rezzer script with a URL that generates a CSV. Click the rezzer, and bookshelves will automatically start to be created, and filled with books. The books will also receive cover textures, if any were specified in the CSV. The books can then be picked up and put in your inventory. Attaching them "opens" them up as HUD, and attaches the Google Docs viewer to the prim, to let you read the PDF.
